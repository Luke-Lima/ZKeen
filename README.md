Hi There, Luke Here.
Basically this is a Fan-Project to Bring the Goodbye Galaxy Trilogy into Modern Systems; With Extra Stuff Like a Patch System, Quick Saves and Quick Loads, VGA support, etc.

## Why?

Because we want to make Commander Keen more Acessible for Newer People who don't Use Dosbox.

Infact: we want to bring Keen to the modern days, so that More people can Play Where PC gaming all-started*;
and if God Forbid we get to make it Compatible with the IotV trilogy or Keen Dreams, We Would make it even more Accessible to play Keen Games.

*Might be Incorrect, due to the Start of PC Gaming being Unknown, but we Know that Commander Keen Kickstarted it all.
